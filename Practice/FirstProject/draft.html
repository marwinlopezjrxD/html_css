    <h1>Music Library</h1>

    <p>the website will consist of anything that is music related <br>
    and shall be designed only by CSS without using other frameworks, this will sure make the user will learn the basics much better. <br>
    it may or may not contain javascript but using scripts is still highly recommended.<br>
