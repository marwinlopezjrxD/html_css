## Realistic Job Targets for 2026 (Based on Current HTML/CSS Level + Planned Growth)

These are the roles I can realistically land in 2026 if I stick to my roadmap (HTML/CSS cert → JavaScript → small portfolio projects → freelance or junior position).

| Job Title                        | Why It Fits Me Right Now                                      | Skills I’ll Add in 2026                              | Entry Strategy                                                                 | Expected Entry-Level Pay (2026 est.) |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Freelance Web Designer           | Already building creative landing pages & forms in my repo   | Advanced CSS (Flexbox/Grid, animations), Figma      | Portfolio site + 5–10 small Upwork/Fiverr gigs                                 | $20–40/hr (or $30K–50K/yr part-time) |
| Junior Front-End Developer       | Questionnaire project already has forms + logic + styling   | JavaScript (DOM, events), Git workflow             | 3–5 solid portfolio projects + apply to remote startups/agencies             | $45K–65K/yr                         |
| Website Maintainer / Content Updater | Comfortable editing existing HTML/CSS files                | Basic WordPress, SEO, accessibility                 | Offer maintenance gigs or volunteer on open-source sites                       | $35K–50K/yr (often part-time)       |
| UI/UX Design Assistant           | Good eye for colors/themes (Saturn project, etc.)           | Figma/Adobe XD, UX principles, prototyping         | Add wireframes of my projects + apply to design teams or apprenticeships      | $40K–60K/yr                         |
| Email Marketing Developer        | Emails = mini HTML/CSS pages → perfect match                 | Inline CSS, responsive email tricks, Mailchimp     | Build 5–10 sample campaigns → freelance on PeoplePerHour or agency roles      | $40K–55K/yr (or $25–35/hr freelance)|

**Goal:** Land my first paid web gig or junior role before the end of 2026  
**Current proof of progress:** This entire repo (95 %+ of the code written with Grok’s help while I recover from 20-month burnout). Every commit is a tiny win.
