# Front-End Development Roadmap  
marwinlopezjrxD – 2026 Edition (CSS-Centric with JS Basics)

## Current Status (November 26, 2025)  
- Completed: Full HTML5 + CSS3 foundation, including advanced layouts and styling  
- All 2025 goals achieved: Questionnaire (interactive form with validation), Subscription form, Music Teasers gallery, Mini_Projects, and extensive dummy_files for prototyping  
- Most committed folders in 2025: questionnaire (core interactivity focus) and dummy_files (asset organization and testing hub)—these formed the backbone of my practice, teaching me iterative design and file management under pressure  
- Ready for a cooler, CSS-deepened phase at a sustainable pace

## 2025 Reflection  
2025 was hot as helly. 🔥👨‍🚒  
- Too much work: Draining, tiring, commits everywhere—rushed iterations on questionnaire and dummy_files left little room for polish  
- Lesson: Prioritize UI/UX design from the start; overcommitment burned me out  

2026 shall be cold as ice. ❄️🥶  
- Less commits, well-detailed: Everything documented inline, with folders for outputs only  
- Priority: Design (UI/UX) more than anything—elegant, accessible CSS first  

## 2026 Roadmap – One Milestone Per Month (Burnout-Proof, CSS-Focused)

| Month          | Focus Area                          | End-of-Month Milestone                                               |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| January 2026   | CSS Attributes & Units              | Master rem/em/px, RGB transparency, color percentages; apply to a responsive card component |
| February 2026  | Box Model & Hierarchy Revisited     | Deep dive into box-sizing, margins/padding; revisit selectors (#, ., !important) in a layout audit of 2025 questionnaire |
| March 2026     | Div Mastery & Flexbox               | Build complex layouts with divs and Flexbox; create a flexible gallery like Music Teasers but with dynamic sizing |
| April 2026     | Grid vs. Flexbox                    | Compare in a split-view project; redesign dummy_files grid for better organization |
| May 2026       | Hovers, Transitions & Animations    | Implement hover effects, fade-ins/outs; add subtle JS for trigger (e.g., onClick animation toggle) |
| June 2026      | Fonts & Typography                  | Explore Google Fonts, variable fonts; style a full typography scale for a mock portfolio page |
| July 2026      | Rest & Review                       | No new topics—audit CSS in existing projects, document learnings, recovery with UI sketches |
| August 2026    | JS Basics: Variables & DOM Intro    | Introduce let/const/var; basic DOM queries to toggle CSS classes (e.g., dark mode switch) |
| September 2026 | JS Basics: Events & Simple Interactivity | Event listeners for hovers/clicks; enhance a Flexbox layout with JS-driven state changes |
| October 2026   | Research: Error Handling & Refactoring | Study JS error catching, when to refactor CSS/JS; edit live via dev console (F12); apply to 2025 Mini_Projects |
| November 2026  | Git & Workflow Polish               | Master git add/commit with branches; document a full refactor of questionnaire using new CSS/JS |
| December 2026  | Portfolio & Wrap-Up                 | Build CSS-heavy portfolio showcasing 2026 evolutions (with light JS); include UI/UX case studies from dummy_files |

## Research Topics (Integrated Monthly)
- **Error Handling**: Use try/catch in JS snippets; validate CSS fallbacks  
- **Refactoring**: Refactor when code repeats 3+ times or readability drops—focus on CSS modularity  
- **Parse Handling**: JSON.parse for any data in JS; CSS custom properties for variables  
- **Dev Console Editing**: Practice F12 tweaks on live sites; commit polished versions  

## JS Basics Snippet (For Reference)
```javascript
var oldStyleVariable = "Hello"; // Older way, function-scoped

let modernVariable = 123;     // Modern way, block-scoped, can be reassigned

const constantValue = true;   // Modern way, block-scoped, cannot be reassigned
