# Revised To-Dos for 2026 Front-End Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the revised to-do list for my 2026 Front-End Development Roadmap. It builds on the original milestones, incorporating adjustments for better pacing, additional resources, and integration of personal wellness checks. All tasks are designed to maintain a burnout-proof schedule while advancing skills in JavaScript, React, and beyond.

Track progress by checking off items as completed. Updates will be reflected in the main README.md.

## General Guidelines
- Commit daily with meaningful messages
- Use branches for each task
- Limit to 8-12 hours/week
- Resources: MDN, freeCodeCamp, React docs, YouTube (Traversy Media)
- Tools: VS Code, GitHub, Vite, Lighthouse

## Git Commands (Workflow Essentials)
- `git add`: Adds changes to staging (e.g., `git add .` for all)
- `git commit`: Records changes (e.g., `git commit -m "Detailed CSS refactor"`)

## SQL Teaser (For Future CRUD Awareness)
- `SELECT * FROM Customers;` – Read all data
- CRUD Basics: Create (INSERT), Read (SELECT), Update (UPDATE), Delete (DELETE) – Prep for 2028 SQL/PHP

## Future Teasers
- 2027: JS Deep Dive / TailwindCSS / Node.js
- 2028: SQL / PHP

## 2026 Guidelines
- One major focus per month (CSS 80%, JS/UI/UX 20%)
- Milestone deadline: last day of each month
- July is a full recovery month (no new learning)
- Weekly time commitment: 8–12 hours maximum
- All work stays in this repo with clear folders and inline documentation
- Personal Rule: “Are You Alright? Can You Hear Me?” – Monthly journal: 1. Am I alright? 2. What does my mind/body need? Pause if unclear. Progress without well-being isn’t real.
