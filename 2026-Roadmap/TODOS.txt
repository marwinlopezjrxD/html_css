    var oldStyleVariable = "Hello"; // Older way, function-scoped

    let modernVariable = 123;     // Modern way, block-scoped, can be reassigned

    const constantValue = true;   // Modern way, block-scoped, cannot be reassigned

git commands 

    git add: Adds changes from the working directory to the staging area, preparing them for the next commit.
