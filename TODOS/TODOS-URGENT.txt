# the 4 picture must have different stylings (spring, summer, autumn, winter).
-- each season will have a different style compared to the main page.

# Spring

Spring palettes evoke freshness, renewal, and optimism. Lighter, brighter pastels are ideal for backgrounds, providing a sense of calm and new beginnings. 
Background Base: Soft whites, cream, or light grey-beige (#E8EEEF).
Accent Colors: Use light greens (mint, lime, moss), warm yellows (buttercup, lemon), coral, or peach for buttons and highlights. 

# Summer

Summer palettes capture energy and warmth while also suggesting refreshing, cool elements. The best backgrounds are light to maintain an airy feel, using vibrant hues for contrast. 
Background Base: Crisp white (#FFFFFF), pale blue, or a very light sand/beige tone (#F3E8DF).
Accent Colors: Incorporate tropical blues, bright yellows, vibrant greens, or hot pinks for a pop of energy and excitement. 

# Autumn

Autumn colors create a cozy, warm, and approachable feel, leveraging earthy tones and rich, saturated hues. Neutral browns and taupes make excellent, grounding backgrounds. 
Background Base: Warm neutrals like gentle beige or taupe, soft browns (#948879), or antique white (#F1F0E9).
Accent Colors: Feature burnt oranges, deep reds (burgundy), golden yellows, olive greens, or bronze accents to evoke warmth and stability. 

# Winter

Winter palettes are generally cool-toned, featuring high contrast and a clean, modern aesthetic. Stark contrast is key to the winter look. 
Background Base: Pure white, icy blues, pale greys (#C2C9CF), or silver tones.
Accent Colors: Utilize stark black for text and deep jewel tones like emerald green, sapphire blue, ruby red, or fuchsia to create a bold visual impact. 

# Key Design Considerations
Readability: White is the most popular background color because it ensures content is easy to read. Ensure sufficient contrast between background and text colors using a contrast checker tool for accessibility.

Consistency: A website often uses a dominant background color (around 60% of the space) combined with secondary and accent colors (30% and 10%).

Brand Identity: Ensure the seasonal colors align with your brand's core message and values for a cohesive user experience.
