# CSS NOTES - Cascade, Specificity & !important

1. How CSS decides the winner
   1. Specificity (selector strength)
   2. Source order (later = wins if specificity equal)
   3. !important (overrides everything - avoid!)

2. Specificity Ranking (weak → strong)
   • Tag selectors          p, div           → weakest (0,0,0,1)
   • Class / attribute / pseudo-class
     .my-class, [type], :hover           → (0,0,1,0)
   • ID selectors           #header          → (0,1,0,0)
   • Inline styles          style="..."      → (1,0,0,0)
   • !important             color: red !important → beats all

3. Source Order Example
   p { color: blue; }
   p { color: red; }   /* this wins - same specificity, comes later */

4. !important Example
   p { color: red !important; }  /* always wins */

5. Quick Rules to Live By
   • Use classes, not IDs, for reusable styles
   • Put your CSS after framework CSS
   • Never use !important unless overriding a plugin/theme
   • When stuck, check DevTools → Computed → look for the winning rule
