# CSS NOTES - Cascade, Specificity & !important

1. How CSS decides the winner
   1. Specificity (selector strength)
   2. Source order (later = wins if specificity equal)
   3. !important (overrides everything - avoid!)

2. Specificity Ranking (weak → strong)
   • Tag selectors          p, div           → weakest (0,0,0,1)
   • Class / attribute / pseudo-class
     .my-class, [type], :hover           → (0,0,1,0)
   • ID selectors           #header          → (0,1,0,0)
   • Inline styles          style="..."      → (1,0,0,0)
   • !important             color: red !important → beats all

3. Source Order Example
   p { color: blue; }
   p { color: red; }   /* this wins - same specificity, comes later */

4. !important Example
   p { color: red !important; }  /* always wins */

5. Quick Rules to Live By
   • Use classes, not IDs, for reusable styles
   • Put your CSS after framework CSS
   • Never use !important unless overriding a plugin/theme
   • When stuck, check DevTools → Computed → look for the winning rule

# GIT NOTES - Dangers & Risks of git reset --hard

1. What git reset --hard Does
   - Resets your branch to a specific commit
   - Overwrites the index (staged files) and working directory to match that commit
   - **Danger**: Permanently discards ALL uncommitted changes (tracked or untracked files)

2. Key Risks
   - **Data Loss**: Unsaved work in files? Gone forever—no undo without backups
   - **Untracked Files**: Deletes anything not yet added to Git (e.g., new files/folders)
   - **Irreversible History**: Rewrites shared branches—can break team workflows
   - **No Safety Net**: Unlike soft/mixed resets, it doesn't preserve your changes

3. When It Bites You
   - Forgot to commit? Run --hard → poof, changes vanish
   - Syncing devices? Mismatched files get nuked without warning

4. Quick Rules to Live By
   - Always run `git status` first—review what's at risk
   - Use `git stash` to save uncommitted work temporarily
   - Prefer `--soft` (keeps changes staged) or `--mixed` (unstaged) for safety
   - For history rewrites, use `git revert` instead—safer for shared repos
   - Backup with `git branch backup` before risky commands
