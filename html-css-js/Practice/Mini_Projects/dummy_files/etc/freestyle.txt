Mga tropa ko'y nagpahinga, habang ako rito'y naghahasa.
Linya na para bang may halong mala mahika.
Saking chic, ubos lahat, walang ititira.

Asan na ang yosi?
Nasan na yung alak?!?
Halika rito tayo na at mag Si-Siesta na.
Pagtitipong Malakasang rat' mag Fiesta ra.

I waited for this moment 
Feels surreal isnt it?
Fate surely is hella lit
Reality hits harder than I think, and?

I am here 
And you are there
This sure really feels like a movie 
A bitter start with a heartwarming end, Christmas Eve?

A time for celebration
time flies granted satisfaction
Cold as Ice, Yet warmth stays as the seasons change
As winter ends, Spring comes forth, End of Ice Age.

Google says it symbolizes new beginnings,
After the cold, dormant months of winter, what things should I encounter?
I've been running away from accountability and responsibility 
But now I am caught deep within a fishnet, lastly

I promise to stay
I won't run away
Time is short
Now I am out of words lol, Heart 🤍
