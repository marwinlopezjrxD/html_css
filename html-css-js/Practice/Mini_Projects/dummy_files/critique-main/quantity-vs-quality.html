     Describe in 3 paragraph sentences
     How quantity and quality differ
     State your side and why is it much
     Better than the other one.


     My side: Quantity
     
     Explanation: You need to create more and from time to time, the more you give, get or produce, the less likely you'll know that
                   the things you produce had the thing called "Quality" already. So thats why More = Good (Quantity), Then after that you make Quality out of it
                   Less = Better (Quality).
