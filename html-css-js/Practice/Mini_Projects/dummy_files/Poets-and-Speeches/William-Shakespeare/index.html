                <strong>Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
                I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
                The evil that men do lives after them;
                The good is oft interred with their bones;
                So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
                Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
                If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
                And grievously hath Caesar answer’d it.
                Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest–
                For Brutus is an honourable man;
                So are they all, all honourable men–
                Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.
                He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
                But Brutus says he was ambitious;
                And Brutus is an honourable man.
                He hath brought many captives home to Rome
                Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
                Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
                When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
                Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
                Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
                And Brutus is an honourable man.
                You all did see that on the Lupercal
                I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
                Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
                Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
                And, sure, he is an honourable man.
                I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
                But here I am to speak what I do know.
                You all did love him once, not without cause:
                What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
                O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
                And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
                My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
                And I must pause till it come back to me.</strong>
