=== Main dishes ===

Adobo

-- The quintessential Filipino comfort food. 
This dish features tender meat (usually pork or chicken) slow-cooked and simmered in a savory, 
tangy sauce made from soy sauce, vinegar, crushed garlic, bay leaves, and black peppercorns. 
It's rich, deeply flavorful, and perfectly paired with a mountain of white rice.

- Adobong Tuyo

-- This is a "dry" version of the classic adobo, 
where the meat is simmered in the adobo marinade until the sauce reduces completely and the meat fries in its own rendered fat. 
The result is an intensely flavorful, concentrated savory and salty bite, often a beloved Filipino breakfast staple served with fried rice and egg.

- Bicol Express

-- A famous dish from the Bicol region, known for its fiery kick and creamy texture. It's a hearty stew made with pork, long green chilies (siling haba), and a generous amount of rich coconut milk, 
often seasoned with shrimp paste (bagoong). It's a spicy, savory, 
and rich main dish that guarantees you'll need extra rice!
