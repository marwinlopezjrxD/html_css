General Knowledge as of now on what I know in this Subscription Website:

index.html
- everything from start to finish is neat.
- will improve some explanation on every bit of it, Its to tedious to change the documentation of all.
- clean spacings on HTML Tags(I do not like messy structure)

style.css
- So hectic to understand it all(Large amounts of CSS attributes have been inserted in this file. If a beginner would see this, They might just call it quits.)
- Not so Beginner-Friendly.
- Even with the hard commenting of every lines, it is still unbearable to read.
- Documention-wise, It's good. But still. 

script.js
- the logic is clean, just like pointers in C++. No questions asked. Absolute Cinema.
- Perfectly utilizing all the variables inside.
- The variables can be used on other projects? Maybe? But it is too tedious and the user will still use another separate script.js file.
