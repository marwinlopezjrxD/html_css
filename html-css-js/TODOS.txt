NOTE: Syncing between devices (phone ↔ laptop)

When editing files directly on GitHub or via phone and committing there,  
the local copy on my laptop will become outdated.

This causes Git conflicts or errors the next time I try to commit or push from the laptop.

To update the laptop copy to match the latest version on GitHub:

1. Open terminal in the project folder
2. Run:
   git fetch origin
   git reset --hard origin/master
3. (Optional, removes untracked files)
   git clean -fd

After these commands, the local files are identical to the remote repository  
and I can continue editing safely.

To upload changes made on laptop:
   git add .
   git commit -m "description"
   git push
