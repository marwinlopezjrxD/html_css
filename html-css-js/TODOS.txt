SYNCING BETWEEN DEVICES (Phone ↔ Laptop)

Warning: Editing directly on GitHub or phone → laptop gets outdated → conflicts!

To update laptop to match GitHub (latest version):
1. Open terminal in project folder
2. Run:
   git fetch origin
   git reset --hard origin/master    # (stick with master for now!)
   git clean -fd                   # (optional: removes new/untracked files)

Now laptop = exactly like GitHub. Safe to edit again.

To push changes from laptop:
   git add .
   git commit -m "your message here"
   git push
